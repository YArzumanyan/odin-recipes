    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This rough puff pastry dough bakes up deliciously light and flaky. It's
      quick to make compared to classic puff pastry — most of the time is for
      chilling. It can be used for savory or sweet recipes, like tarts, hand
      pies, or palmiers.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
      <li>½ cup cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
        attachment. Add butter and toss with your fingertips until evenly coated
        with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add water to bowl. Mix on low speed until the dough forms a shaggy mass,
        about 45 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until butter is firm but
        not brittle, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll into a ½-inch-thick
        rectangle that is about 10 ½ x 6 inches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold one third of the longer side of the dough over the center third of
        dough. Fold the final third over the center (like you would fold a
        letter). Tightly wrap folded dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
        chilled, about 30 minutes. Repeat this process of rolling, folding and
        refrigerating 4 more times, turning the dough 90 degrees each time
        before rolling.
      </li>
      <li>
        After completing the final fold, wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap
        and refrigerate until firm before using, at least 1 hour or up to 2
        days.
      </li>
    </ol>
